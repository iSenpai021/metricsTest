Steps to follow: 
1. Have intellij and mysql and postman installed on your machine. 
2. Make sure Java jdk is installed. For this project, it is using Java 17 and gradle.
3. Within mysql make sure that a database server is up and running and create a schema. 
4. For this instance I created a schema called metricsTest.
5. Whichever name you give your schema, make sure the name is put in application.properties: 'spring.datasource.url' with the username and password to access the database.
